# HealthFirst: AI-Powered Healthcare Chatbot

## Description
HealthFirst is an AI-driven healthcare chatbot designed to provide users with basic medical recommendations using advanced natural language processing. This project is part of my learning journey to master LangChain and LangGraph, integrating key concepts to create an intelligent virtual assistant for health-related queries.

The chatbot is powered by the GROQ-API, enabling real-time responses from a robust language model. Users can receive general health recommendations, and if a query appears critical or beyond the chatbot's scope, it will advise the user to consult a medical professional.

HealthFirst leverages a Flask backend to manage API routes and communication with the AI model. MongoDB is used as the database to store user interactions and chat history. The ReactJS front-end provides an interactive and user-friendly experience, ensuring seamless communication between the user and the chatbot.
